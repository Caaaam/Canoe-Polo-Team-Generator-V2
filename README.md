# Canoe-Polo-Team-Generator-V2

A Team generator for training sessions, input players and a score out of 100 into the csv as shown and the code will automatically assign players into relatively even teams. 

## Future additions: 
- Sort function for csv players (incase they aren't in order)
- Allow selection of players (ideally in GUI), and then select these from the csv
- Allow changing of iterations used
- GUI interface (tkinter or similar)
- Selenium web scraping from facebook poll (this may be a challenge..)
